/**
 * Control-plane events: lifecycle + guardrail notifications.
 *
 * Architecture (see docs/25): these are the subset of `PersistedEventType`
 * that should fan out from the JSONL event log into the in-process
 * `EventBus`. Data-plane events (the TURN/MESSAGE/TEXT_DELTA/TOOL families)
 * stay in the log only — they are high-frequency and not actionable as
 * notifications.
 *
 * The bus is the fan-out target for in-process subscribers (analytics,
 * watchdog, cross-guardrail coordination). SSE and the desktop UI read the
 * event log directly and do NOT consume the bus.
 */

/**
 * The one and only control-plane list. `ControlEventType` is derived from it,
 * and `event-log.ts` builds its lookup set from the same array — a new event
 * type is added HERE, once. (Previously this list and the set in event-log.ts
 * were two hand-copied 15-item lists glued by a cast; adding a type to one
 * side silently drifted from the other.)
