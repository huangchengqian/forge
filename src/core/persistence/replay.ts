/**
 * Result of replaying a session from its event log.
 *
 * `messages` is the authoritative reconstruction: each entry comes from a
 * `MESSAGE_ENDED` payload (terminal state, not streaming snapshots). Audit
 * events like `STUCK_WARNING`, `COST_UPDATE`, `GUARD_BLOCKED`,
 * `VERIFICATION_RESULT`, `STEERING_QUEUED`, `SESSION_*` are deliberately
 * NOT replayed — they describe guardrail activity, not conversation state.
 * Recovering guardrail state would mean re-running policy decisions on
 * historical events, which we don't want; instead, the session's persisted
 * `cost.total` is loaded separately and fed into a fresh CostGuard.
 *
 * Note on pairing: Pi's `AgentMessage` (UserMessage / AssistantMessage /
 * ToolResultMessage) has no `id` field — id is a `SessionEntry` concept
 * (the on-disk format), not an in-memory one. So replay does not pair
 * MESSAGE_STARTED with MESSAGE_ENDED; it just walks the events in append
 * order (FIFO guarantees chronological order — see event-log.ts) and
 * collects every `MESSAGE_ENDED.message`. A user/assistant/toolResult
 * message that was mid-stream when the process crashed simply never
 * produced a MESSAGE_ENDED event and is therefore absent from the
 * recovered transcript — that's the correct behaviour (we drop the
 * half-baked message rather than feeding it to the next LLM call).
