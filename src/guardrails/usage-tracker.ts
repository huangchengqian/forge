/**
 * Per-session usage statistics — the pipeline formerly known as CostGuard.
 * The dollar layer (client-side price estimation + budget circuit breaker)
 * was removed 2026-09-11: pricing depends on Pi's model catalog (custom
 * endpoints report $0) and no UI path ever set a budget, so the stopper
 * never fired and the gauge lied. Money control belongs to the provider.
 *
 * What remains is the load-bearing part:
 *  - cumulative token counters (fed from assistant-message usage), and
 *  - the context watermark: the most recent assistant message's
 *    calculateContextTokens — the same signal Pi's own shouldCompact uses —
 *    which the prepareNextTurn hook reads to trigger compaction. The current
 *    turn's number is what matters, not cumulative usage (cumulative
 *    double-counts prior turns).
 *
 * Note: some providers (MiniMax anthropic-compat, e.g.) bill the whole prompt
 * as cacheWrite and report input=0 — never use usage.input alone as the
 * watermark; calculateContextTokens (totalTokens, falling back to the
 * component sum) is the honest signal.
