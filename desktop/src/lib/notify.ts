/**
 * Task-outcome notification.
 *
 * Scope: a finished session is already reported in place — timeline notices,
 * the verification panel, and the sidebar status dot all update on their own.
 * So there is deliberately no in-app toast host here; a floating toast would
 * only restate what is on screen. This module covers the one case the
 * conversation view cannot: the window is hidden and the user would otherwise
 * never learn the outcome.
 *
 * Transport: the Tauri notification plugin (the Web Notification API is
 * unavailable inside the webview), falling back to Web Notification in browser
 * dev. Delivery is best-effort — a missing permission is not an error.
